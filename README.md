# Pandas Data Manipulation Project

This project consists of a series of Python scripts that demonstrate various data manipulation tasks using the Pandas 
library. Each script focuses on a specific aspect of data manipulation, such as data cleaning, filtering, grouping, 
visualization, and more.

## INSTALLATION

### Requirements

- Python 3.12.0
- Requirements listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository download the repository to your local machine to access the scripts.
2. Install dependencies in terminal using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 
3. Each script can be executed independently by running it in a Python environment. 
4. Ensure that the necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) are installed. 
5. Open the desired script file and execute it using a Python interpreter or an integrated development environment (IDE)
like Jupyter Notebook or Colaboratory. Alternatively, you can open PP3_Pandas_Completed.ipynb where all 10 sections are 
included for easy execution and exploration. Additionally, you can open PP3_Pandas.ipynb and complete the project 
exercises by yourself.
